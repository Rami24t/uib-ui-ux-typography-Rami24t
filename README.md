## Let's create a typography site and learn some more about typography in the process!

You'll find the content and it's outline in the content directory. The content is essentialy some short summaries and links to useful books/articles/websites about typography.

### Objectives

- Create a nav that has internal links to each of the sections on the page
- Add the img in the img directory as a background image
- Each heading should have a different font - see the attached `style-guide`
- Style each link's different states: `link`, `visited`, `active`, and `hover`

- Use inline elements `<em>`, `<strong>`, etc... where appropriate.
- Use text properites `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, `text-decoration`, `text-shadow`, etc... where appropriate.
- Use css units `em`, `rem`, `%`, etc... where appropriate.

And don't forget to check out the links! They'll take you to some pretty neat typography resources.
